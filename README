Mx is my attempt at a Javascript only game engine.

To run the game:
	1. download files at https://minond@github.com/minond/Mx.git
	2. load the Mx directory in your browser.
	3. and navigate to the "mx.html" file
	4. you will be prompted to enter the assignment to load, enter "assignment1" to load Assignemt 1.
	5. note: make sure to load project in either Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome
